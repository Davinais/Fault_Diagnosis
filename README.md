# Fault_Diagnosis

Introduction:
	As the best test expert in our NTU-ATPG company, your team are asked to implement 
a diagnosis tool for single stuck-at faults and multiple stuck-at faults.  To test 
our tool, we will have to first generate fail log files.  Then you will need to 
diagnose these fail log files and give a ranked list of suspects.  The failing output
will then be diagnosed by your tool.  This project will be graded based on diagnosis
accuracy, and diagnosis resolution, and run time.
